<h1>Scholarship Programme</h1>
<p>
  Web Rebels is a conference organised by and for the community,
  and it's important to us that all members of the community
  should be included, also those who would normally be unable to
  attend for financial reasons. We're very happy to be able to
  offer <em>The Web Rebels Scholarship Programme</em> to offer financial
  aid to people from underrepresented groups wanting to attend the
  conference.

<a name="eligibility"></a>
<h2>Eligibility</h2>
<p>
  Scholarships are primarily intended to assist people from groups
  traditionally underrepresented in the local developer community,
  including women, people of non-Scandinavian descent and people
  with disabilities. However, we wouldn't presume to be able to
  provide a complete list of underrepresented groups, so all
  applications will be considered. Eligibility ultimately depends
  on the discretion of the selection committee.

<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>
  All applications will be reviewed by the selection committee,
  and will be accepted at their discretion, although selection
  will primarily favour diversity concerns and financial need. All
  information provided to the committee will be kept strictly
  confidential.

<h2>Award</h2>
<p>
  Selected applicants will receive a fully paid ticket for the
  conference, and may also apply for travel and lodging
  assistance, although our ability to offer this will be more
  limited.
